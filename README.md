# DSCI_551_project
Wildlife Diversity Monitoring \
This is for USC DSCI 551 FALL 2020 project
# Description
The goal of this project is to allow users to search for some specific species of animals. In this case, it allows users to view the recorded positions, sexes, ages of those animals. All images used in my project are captured by wildlife camera traps. 
There are hundreds of projects recording wildlife. And, in most cases, most project owners just share their images or information on social media, such as Twitter or Facebook. The motivation of this project is to build a platform where normal people like me who like animals can search and see different animal images from diverse projects. In addition, people can visualize those images in the map so as to get a sense of the animal diversity in certain areas.
